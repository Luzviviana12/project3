        <p>This is my first project for my ITMD (web development) class! I am utilizing HTML to create a basic website with videos, pictures, and links. I originally wanted to go into medicine and become a doctor. I even went to a medical-based high school. However, in my junior year of high school, a new coding club was set up at my school.</p>
        <p>I was curious and joined it alongside one of my friends. It was a class about creating basic Java for video games and I really enjoyed it. With my peers, we were able to make a very basic maze game with the help of our instructors. That is when I decided to change my career path to tech.</p>
        <p>When I got to university, I decided to major in computer science. It was very different from the previous experience I had with coding and was less fun and a lot more math-based. I was not secure about the major I had chosen, and my roommate recommended I transfer to another. After some research, I landed on Game Design and made my switch.</p>
        <p>Since switching my major, I enjoy what I study and have the ability to work on many different things such as my art, programming, project management, and writing skills. I love being able to mix them together and study them interchangeably!</p>
        <p>Here are a few pieces I have made for a game I published for a class:</p>
        <img src="media/project.png" alt="A poster I made for a class to capture the attention of potential new players for a game I helped make.">
        <p>This is a map I made for a tabletop roleplay game where the players are pirates and try to steal gold from sirens. I took inspiration from others' maps of this similar style and tried to make the paper look as dirty and worn as possible.</p>

        <p>This is a poster I made for a game I helped create in a class. It was an educational game aimed at elementary and middle school-aged children to help encourage them to write. My group incorporated a more creative aesthetic from other games and media sources like Hollow Knight and Luigi's Haunted Mansion.</p>
